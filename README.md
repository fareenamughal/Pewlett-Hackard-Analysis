---

The overview of this analysis is to enable Pewlett-Hackard to plan and prepare for the upcoming retirements. To be specific, the new analysis sought to findout the number of current employees that will be retiring analysed by their title. In addition to this the analysis aims to find out the number of employees presently employed and grouped based on thier title at the start of their employment, to ensure that duplicate or multiple titles as a result of e.g. promotions are eliminated to provide a more meaningful analysis of the retirements per department or title. The analysis also aims to provide insights about the current employees who would be eligible for mentorship which would help with the succession planning.

## Results
There is a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. (6 pt)
The results of the analysis are as follows:
A. Retirement Titles table for employees who are born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955.
  
  1. The Retirement Titles table - exported as retirement_titles.csv
     [Analysis Projects Folder/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis Folder/Data/retirement_titles.csv](https://github.com/fareenamughal/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/615cd04da28b7da500f5c9d4975cd7f1a0103f87/Analysis%20Projects%20Folder/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis%20Folder/Data/retirement_titles.csv)


  2. Retirement_titles table extract

     ![Retirement_titles_tbl_extract](https://github.com/fareenamughal/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/6d69c05ce9c706aa7208f264d8ea372d8ea86587/Analysis%20Projects%20Folder/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis%20Folder/Queries/Retirement_titles_tbl_extract.PNG)
  
   The retirement titles table lists down all the titles in Pewlett Hackard (PH). The table indicates that there are 133,776 records or staff close to retirement. This    table, however, fails to account for the employees who have already left Pewlett or the duplicated records as a result of promotions or transfers. Further analysis    should be carried out to eliminate duplication of records or titles and redundand records or records of employees who have already left PH.


B. Unique Titles table that contains the employee number, first and last name, and most recent title.
  
  1. The Unique Titles table - exported as unique_titles.csv. 
    
     https://github.com/fareenamughal/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Analysis%20Projects%20Folder/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis%20Folder/Data/unique_titles.csv

  2. Unique_titles table extract
     
      ![Unique_titles_tbl_extract](https://github.com/fareenamughal/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/a34976e293e6b5807e77e861353a2db0889f24c1/Analysis%20Projects%20Folder/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis%20Folder/Queries/Unique_titles_tbl_extract.PNG)
     
     
   The unique titles table is similar to the Retirement titles table with further filtering to eliminate the duplicated records due to e.g. promotions and records for    staff who have already left. The analysis indicates that there are 72,458 records or employees who are nearing retirement, a difference of 61,318 records as            compared to the retirement titles table. This signifies how important it is to have accurate analysis.  


C. Retiring Titles table that contains the number of titles filled by employees who are retiring
  
  1. The Retiring Titles table is exported as retiring_titles.csv.

  2. Retiring titles table
